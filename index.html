			<p>Howdy World! I am a front end web developer with experience working with a full stack. I am <span>almost</span> a true Austinite, (I was born in Dallas...please don't tell anyone) I was lucky enough to grow up in Austin and it is the place that I am proud to call home. When I was a kid I watched the city grow and change largely due to the tech industry, now as an adult I want to be a part of that change and make my own contribution to the ever-evolving Austin tech landscape.</p>
			<p>After gradutating college I got a job working for the Alamo Drafthouse and contributed to the Austin culture in that way. I am very proud of the time I have spent at the Alamo and the impact that I had on the company as a bar trainer at new venues and as the bar manager at the Ritz. Working at the Alamo proved to be a high-stress and fast paced environment and a great place to learn how to communicate lots of information to lots of different people as efficiently as possible.</p>
			<p>The tech industry finally drew me in. With an infinite amount of things to learn, make and share I am excited to work wcollaboratively with diverse groups of people and build cool projects. I have worked with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Materialize, JavaScript, Node.js, Express, Handlebars, mySQL, Sequelize, Firebase, MongoDB and React. Please take a look at my portfolio to see some of the stuff I've built.</p>
